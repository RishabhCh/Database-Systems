# Database-Systems
This repository contains files that have Database creations and some queries implemented on them.
The Project - Creating and querying databases contains a schema and some queries on it. 
The attractive part about the project is the presence of parsers. There are 2 parsers - 
The first one creates insert statements for sql tables from raw data and the other one creates JSONs for creation of Mongo schema.
There is also a Null value checker python notebook which checks NULL values in raw data.
